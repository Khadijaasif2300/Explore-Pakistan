      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The **Princess of Hope** is a famous natural rock formation situated inside **Hingol National Park** in 
        Balochistan, Pakistan. It is named so because the structure resembles a standing princess gazing into 
        the horizon. The name was given by Hollywood actress **Angelina Jolie** during her visit to the area in 2002.
      </p>
      <p>
        Formed naturally through centuries of wind and rain erosion, the Princess of Hope has become one of 
        the most recognized symbols of Hingol National Park and the Makran Coastal Highway.
