      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The Quaid-e-Azam Residency, commonly known as **Ziarat Residency**, is a national heritage site located in 
        Ziarat, Balochistan. This wooden structure, surrounded by ancient juniper forests, holds immense historical 
        significance as it served as the residence of Pakistan’s founder, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, during the last months 
        of his life in 1948.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, it stands as a symbol of Pakistan’s independence struggle and is one of the most visited historical 
        landmarks in the country.
