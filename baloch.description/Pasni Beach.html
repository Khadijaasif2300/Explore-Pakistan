      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Pasni Beach</strong> lies along the Arabian Sea beside the fishing port of Pasni, about 135 km east of Gwadar
        on the Makran Coastal Highway. Known for its quiet coves, sandy stretches and rocky headlands, the area offers calm
        seascapes, local fishing culture and coastal birdlife.
      </p>
      <p>
        The town’s economy revolves around fishing and small-scale ship repair, and the beach is a great place to watch
        traditional wooden boats (dhows), sunrise/sunset hues, and migratory seabirds.
