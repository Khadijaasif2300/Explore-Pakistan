      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Gwadar Port</strong> is a warm-water deep-sea seaport on the Arabian Sea in Balochistan, situated on
        Gwadar Bay near the mouth of the Gulf of Oman. With its natural depth and strategic location, the port serves as a
        key maritime hub for regional trade and connectivity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just northwest of the port lies <strong>Hammerhead</strong>—a striking, hammer-shaped headland formed by wind and
        water erosion. The sandstone/mudstone promontory offers sweeping views of the Arabian Sea, the crescent-shaped
        coastline, and the city of Gwadar.
