      <p>
        The <strong>Pir Ghaib Waterfalls</strong> are one of the most stunning natural wonders of Balochistan, 
        located in the Bolan Valley near Mach. Surrounded by rocky mountains and lush greenery, 
        the waterfalls cascade into clear blue pools, creating an oasis in the desert-like landscape.

        The site is not only famous for its natural beauty but also holds religious and historical significance. 
        According to local legend, <em>Pir Ghaib</em> (The Invisible Saint) disappeared mysteriously while being pursued, 
        leaving behind these waterfalls as a symbol of divine presence.
