      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The Faisalabad Clock Tower, locally known as “Ghanta Ghar,” is one of the oldest monuments of the city, built in 1903 
        during British rule. It stands at the center of the city and is surrounded by eight bazaars, 
        laid out in the pattern of the British Union Jack flag.
      </p>
      <p>
        These bazaars form the commercial heart of Faisalabad, famous for textiles, spices, jewelry, and traditional goods, 
        making the area both a historical landmark and a bustling marketplace.
