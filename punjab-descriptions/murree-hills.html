      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Murree, often called the “Queen of Hills,” is a famous hill station located in the Pir Panjal range of the Himalayas,
        around 60 kilometers northeast of Islamabad in Punjab, Pakistan. At an altitude of about 7,000 feet above sea level,
        Murree is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the country.
      </p>
      <p>
        Known for its pine forests, snow-covered winters, and pleasant summers, Murree has long been a retreat for people
        seeking relief from the scorching plains of Punjab. It also carries historical significance as a British colonial-era
        hill station.
