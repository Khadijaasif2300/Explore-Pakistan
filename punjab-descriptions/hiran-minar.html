      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Hiran Minar, located in Sheikhupura, Punjab, Pakistan, is a 17th-century Mughal complex built during the reign of
        Emperor Jahangir. The site was constructed in memory of his beloved pet antelope, Mansraj, symbolizing the Mughal
        affinity for nature and animals. Surrounded by a large water tank and connected with causeways, Hiran Minar
        served as both a hunting retreat and a monument of remembrance.

    <h2>Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      The main feature of Hiran Minar is a tall minaret, approximately 100 feet high, built in memory of the antelope.
      The structure is surrounded by a vast rectangular water tank measuring about 750 by 895 feet, with brick walls and
      stone steps leading down to the water.

    <p>
      At the center of the tank stands a square pavilion, accessible through four stone causeways aligned with the
      cardinal directions. The blend of the monument with its natural surroundings reflects Mughal aesthetics of harmony
      between architecture and landscape.
