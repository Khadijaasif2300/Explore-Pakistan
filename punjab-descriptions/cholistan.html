      <p>
        The Cholistan Desert, locally known as <em>Rohi</em>, is located in Bahawalpur District, Punjab. 
        Covering about 16,000 square kilometers, it extends into the Thar Desert of Sindh and Rajasthan (India). 
        The desert is known for its golden sand dunes, nomadic lifestyle, ancient forts, and cultural heritage.

        that reflect the resilience and vibrancy of its people.
