      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The Tomb of Jahangir is located in Shahdara, Lahore, on the banks of the Ravi River. It was built in 1637 by
        Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his father, Jahangir, who ruled the Mughal Empire from 1605 to 1627. The tomb is
        surrounded by beautiful Mughal gardens laid out in the Charbagh style and is one of the finest examples of early
        Mughal funerary architecture. Uniquely, the tomb does not have a central dome, as Jahangir wished to be buried
        under the open sky.

      Four slender minarets, each about 100 feet high, stand at the corners of the platform. They are decorated with
