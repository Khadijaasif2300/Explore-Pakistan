            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                The Tomb of Jahangir is located in Shahdara, Lahore, on the banks of the Ravi River. It was built in
                1637 by
                Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his father, Jahangir, who ruled the Mughal Empire from 1605 to 1627. The
                tomb is
                surrounded by beautiful Mughal gardens laid out in the Charbagh style and is one of the finest examples
                of early
                Mughal funerary architecture. Uniquely, the tomb does not have a central dome, as Jahangir wished to be
                buried
                under the open sky.

            Four slender minarets, each about 100 feet high, stand at the corners of the platform. They are decorated
            with
            marble and provide a striking elegance to the building.
