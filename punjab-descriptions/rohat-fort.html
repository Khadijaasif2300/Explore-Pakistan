            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Rohtas Fort, located near Jhelum in Punjab, Pakistan, is a massive 16th-century fortress built by Sher
                Shah Suri
                between 1541 and 1548. The fort was constructed to serve as a stronghold against the Mughal emperor
                Humayun and
                to suppress the local Gakhar tribes of the region. It is one of the largest and most formidable forts in
                South
                Asia, known for its exceptional defensive architecture that combines Afghan and Persian styles.
