      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Rohtas Fort, located near Jhelum in Punjab, Pakistan, is a massive 16th-century fortress built by Sher Shah Suri
        between 1541 and 1548. The fort was constructed to serve as a stronghold against the Mughal emperor Humayun and
        to suppress the local Gakhar tribes of the region. It is one of the largest and most formidable forts in South
        Asia, known for its exceptional defensive architecture that combines Afghan and Persian styles.
