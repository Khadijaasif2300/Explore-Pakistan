      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The Shrine of Sultan Bahu is located on the banks of the Chenab River in Garh Maharaja, Jhang District, 
        Punjab, Pakistan. Sultan Bahu (1628–1691 CE) was a famous Sufi saint, poet, and founder of the Sarwari Qadiri 
        Sufi order. His poetry, written in Punjabi, carries deep mystical meanings and emphasizes love for God and the 
        Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).
      </p>

        The shrine is one of the most visited spiritual centers in Punjab, attracting thousands of devotees every year 
        for Urs celebrations and daily prayers. It is not only a spiritual hub but also a symbol of Punjabi Sufi culture.

    <h2>Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      The shrine reflects traditional Indo-Islamic architecture with influences from Mughal design. It is built 
      primarily with red brick and decorated with glazed tile work. The dome and minarets highlight the grandeur 
      of the structure, while the interior is adorned with Quranic calligraphy and intricate floral patterns.

      Over time, the shrine has been expanded to accommodate large numbers of devotees. The spacious courtyard, 
      prayer halls, and resting areas make it not just a mausoleum but also a vibrant spiritual complex.
