        The Tomb of Shah Rukn-e-Alam is one of the most important and magnificent monuments of Multan, 
        Punjab, Pakistan. It is the mausoleum of the revered Sufi saint Sheikh Rukn-ud-Din Abul Fateh 
        (commonly known as Shah Rukn-e-Alam), who lived during the 13th–14th century.

    <h2>Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      The mausoleum is an octagonal structure built of red brick and decorated with beautiful blue and white 
      glazed tiles, a hallmark of Multan’s craftsmanship. Rising to a height of 35 meters, the tomb is topped 
      by a massive white dome that dominates the skyline of Multan.

    <p>
      Its architectural design is considered a forerunner of Mughal architecture, featuring tapering walls, 
      decorative battlements, arched niches, and wooden beams. The use of colored tiles and geometric motifs 
      reflects early Indo-Islamic art and the spiritual essence of Sufi shrines.
