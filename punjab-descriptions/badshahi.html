            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                The Badshahi Mosque, located in Lahore, Pakistan, is one of the largest and most iconic mosques in the
                world. Built in 1673 by the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, it stands as a masterpiece of Mughal architecture,
                reflecting grandeur, balance, and intricate artistry. The mosque has historically served not only as a
                place of worship but also as a symbol of the Mughal Empire’s cultural and spiritual legacy. With its
                vast courtyard capable of accommodating over 55,000 worshippers, the mosque remains a central site for
                religious gatherings and cultural heritage in Pakistan.

                Its architectural brilliance lies in the harmonious use of red sandstone, marble inlay, and grand domes
                and minarets, making it a true representation of Mughal elegance and strength.

                military purposes until 1852, when restoration efforts were initiated. The Badshahi Mosque Authority was
                later established to oversee preservation.</li>
            <li><strong>1947:</strong> Following independence, the mosque became a symbol of Pakistan’s Islamic
                heritage. Large gatherings, including Eid prayers, have been regularly held there since.</li>
            <li><strong>1960s–1980s:</strong> Extensive restoration projects were carried out under the guidance of the
                Government of Pakistan and international support, returning the mosque closer to its original Mughal
