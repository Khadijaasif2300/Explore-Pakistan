      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Hawksbay Beach is one of the most famous beaches near Karachi, located along the Arabian Sea. 
        It is a favorite spot for families, tourists, and picnickers due to its clean sandy shores, 
        calm environment, and accessibility from the city.

        The beach is also well known for its turtle population, as endangered green sea turtles 
        come here to lay eggs during the nesting season, making it an important ecological site.
