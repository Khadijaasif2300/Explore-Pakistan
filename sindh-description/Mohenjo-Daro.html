      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Mohenjo-Daro, meaning "Mound of the Dead," is one of the most important archaeological sites of the 
        Indus Valley Civilization. Located near Larkana in Sindh, Pakistan, it was built around 2500 BCE 
        and is considered one of the world’s earliest major cities.
      </p>
      <p>
        The city demonstrates advanced urban planning with streets laid out in a grid, well-organized 
        drainage systems, and standardized fired-brick structures. Mohenjo-Daro reflects the remarkable 
        achievements of an ancient civilization that flourished along the Indus River.
