      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The Chaukhandi Tombs, situated about 29 km east of Karachi along the National Highway, form a remarkable
        early-Islamic cemetery in Sindh. Dating from the 15th to 18th centuries, these tombs are primarily associated
        with the Jokhio tribe and other Sindhi-Baloch clans.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recognized for their intricate sandstone carvings and unique architectural style, the tombs are included on
        UNESCO’s Tentative World Heritage list. They remain one of Pakistan’s most important heritage sites.

    <h2>Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      The tombs are built from yellow sandstone, typically arranged in pyramid-like structures. Each tomb is formed by
      stacked slabs decorated with floral, geometric, and figurative motifs. Male graves often show carvings of weapons
      and horsemen, while female tombs display jewelry patterns such as necklaces and bangles.

    <p>
      Some tombs are sheltered by pillared canopies resembling Hindu pavilions. Unlike most Islamic cemeteries, these
      graves are oriented south-to-north, a unique feature of the Chaukhandi style.
