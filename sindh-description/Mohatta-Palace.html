      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Mohatta Palace is a stunning heritage building located in Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan. 
        It was built in 1927 by Shivratan Chandraratan Mohatta, a wealthy Hindu businessman, 
        as his summer residence. After the partition of India in 1947, the palace was taken 
        over by the government of Pakistan and has since served various purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, Mohatta Palace is a museum that showcases the cultural, historical, and artistic 
        heritage of Pakistan. It is one of the most visited tourist attractions in Karachi and 
        a fine example of colonial-era architecture blended with local design traditions.
