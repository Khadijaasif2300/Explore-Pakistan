        Ranikot Fort, located in Jamshoro District, Sindh, is one of the world’s largest forts, 
        with a circumference of approximately 32 kilometers. 
        Often called the "Great Wall of Sindh," the fort is believed to have been originally built 
        during the Sassanian era and later reconstructed by the Talpur dynasty in the 19th century.
