      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Frere Hall, located in Karachi, Sindh, is one of the city’s most iconic heritage sites. 
        Constructed in 1865 during the British Raj, it was originally intended to serve as Karachi’s town hall.
        The building was named after Sir Henry Bartle Edward Frere, a British colonial administrator.

        Today, Frere Hall serves as a library, art gallery, and cultural space, attracting both locals and tourists. 
        Its surrounding gardens, known as Bagh-e-Jinnah, provide a peaceful escape in the heart of Karachi.
