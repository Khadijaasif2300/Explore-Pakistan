      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Kumrat Valley</strong> is located in the Upper Dir District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. Nestled in the
        Hindu Raj mountain range, the valley is celebrated for its dense coniferous forests, flowing rivers, and green
        alpine meadows. It is one of the emerging tourist destinations in northern Pakistan, offering peace, natural
        beauty, and opportunities for outdoor adventure.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Panjkora River flows through the valley, providing a scenic and tranquil environment. Kumrat Valley remains
        relatively untouched compared to other northern tourist spots, making it ideal for nature lovers and eco-tourists.
