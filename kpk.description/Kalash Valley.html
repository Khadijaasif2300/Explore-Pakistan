      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>Kalash Valley</strong> (often used to refer collectively to the three Kalash valleys — Bumburet, Rumbur and
        Birir) lies in the Hindu Kush mountains of Chitral District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The Kalash are an indigenous
        community with distinct language, dress, music and festivals that set them apart in the region.
      </p>
      <p>
        The valleys are celebrated for their vibrant wooden houses, terraced fields, fruit orchards, and spectacular views
        of alpine peaks. Tourism here focuses on cultural exchange, trekking, and enjoying local hospitality.
