      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Fairy Meadows</strong> (locally called "Joot") is an iconic high-altitude meadow located in the Diamer
        District of Gilgit-Baltistan. Framed by dense coniferous forest, alpine pastures and dramatic cliffs, it offers
        one of the best panoramic views of <em>Nanga Parbat</em> (8,126 m), the ninth highest mountain in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        The meadows are famous for trekking, photography, camping and peaceful nature retreats. Due to its altitude and
        alpine climate, the area is accessible mainly in the summer months when roads and trails are open.
